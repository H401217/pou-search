# pou-search
A LÖVE2D application that allows you to use some Pou online functions.
You can currently search Pous.
# How to use
This application is only functional on PC due to window mode

You can download source code as a .zip file but you need to edit it because it downloads the source code inside a folder and LÖVE2D wouldn't recognize the main.lua

1. Unzip the file
2. Go to pou-search-main folder
3. Zip all the folder (pou-search-main) content
4. Change the new zip extension from .zip to .love
5. If you have LÖVE installed then you can open the .love file by clicking in it. If you have LÖVE2D downloaded as a folder with an executable, then you can drag the .love file to love.exe (or lovec.exe)



Download LÖVE2D in https://love2d.org/ to open the .love file
